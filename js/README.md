NOTE: currently this file is only for development purpose in this stage.

This folder contains the following NPM projects:

- onnxruntime-common
- onnxruntime-node
- onnxruntime-web
- onnxruntime-react-native

Also, this folder contains a `.vscode` folder for Visual Studio Code workspace configs. Using VSCode to open this folder will allow code-formatting and linting features on typescript and C/C++ source code inside this folder.

## onnxruntime-common

> language: typescript

> dependency:

> folder: <ORT_ROOT>/js/common

This project is designed to include all "common" code, which are pure javascript that can run in both Node.js and browsers.

It should be able to consumed by both from projects that uses NPM packages (through a Node.js folder structure of `node_modules` folder that generated by `npm install onnxruntime-common`) and from a CDN service that serves a `.min.js` file.

Following are included in `onnxruntime-common`:

- `InferenceSession` interfaces
- `Tensor`/`OnnxValue` interfaces, implementation and a set of utility functions
- `Backend` interfaces and a set utility functions

## onnxruntime-node

> language: typescript/C++

> dependency: onnxruntime-common, ONNXRuntime.dll

> folder: <ORT_ROOT>/js/node

This project is designed to be used as a NPM package to enable Node.js users to consume ONNX Runtime via Node.js binding, in Node.js or any Node.js compatible environment.

It should be able to consumed by from projects that uses NPM packages (through a Node.js folder structure of `node_modules` folder that generated by `npm install onnxruntime-node`).

## onnxruntime-web

> language: typescript

> dependency: onnxruntime-common, onnxruntime_wasm.wasm

> folder: <ORT_ROOT>/js/web

TBD: this is basically replacement of onnx.js

It should be able to consumed by both from projects that uses NPM packages (through a Node.js folder structure of `node_modules` folder that generated by `npm install onnxruntime-web`) and from a CDN service that serves a `.min.js` file and one or multiple `.wasm` file(s).

## onnxruntime-react-native

TBD

### Files under <ORT_ROOT>/js

Following files are used for code-formatting and linting features for developers:

- .vscode/\*\*
- packages.json
- packages-lock.json
- .eslintrc.js
- .clang-format

### Using VSCode to develop:

1. in `<ORT_ROOT>/js`, run:
   > npm ci
2. use VSCode to open folder `<ORT_ROOT>/js`
3. install VSCode extension if not installed yet:
   - Clang-Format
   - ESLint

To populate typescript type declarations, in each projects, run `npm ci`.
